### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Raghav Sikaria, currently a Specialist Software Engineer at Societe Generale here in Bengaluru and have cleared the CFA Level 1 examination. I aspire to work in the FinTech domain, more specifically Data Science. I also am exploring Quantitative Finance.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning algorithms, demystifying their underlying Math and exploring Time Series Analysis
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the project [NIFTYBANK - Time Series Analysis, Prediction & Hyper Parameter Optimization](https://github.com/raghavsikaria/Project-Rajasuyya)
- âš¡ My website: You can visit my website - [raghavsikaria.github.io](raghavsikaria.github.io) to know more about my projects, blogs & me
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/raghavsikaria/](linkedin.com/in/raghavsikaria/)
  - GMail: raghavsikaria9@gmail.com

#### My Projects & Blogs

Ever since the COVID lockdown began here in India, I have blogged religiously on Machine Learning algorithms and taken up quite a few projects based on Finance domain. I have written detailed blogs for my Finance domain & other ML based projects. Here are some direct links to get to them:

And for covering underlying Mathematics in ML Algorithms, I have started my [Know The Math series](https://raghavsikaria.github.io/tag/know_the_math) of blogs. Till now I have covered:

- [Know The Math - Everything Logistic Regression](https://raghavsikaria.github.io/posts/2020-07-01-ktm-logistic-regression)
- [Know The Math - Linear Regression & the Coefficients via Ordinary Least Squares](https://raghavsikaria.github.io/posts/2020-06-25-ktm-linear-regression)
